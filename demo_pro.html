        i dont know how much i like 
        and love him but he always
        disrespects me with his words
        lim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and
         raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion,
          repeatedly overran South Asia's <b style="color:blueviolet">north-western</b> plains, l
          eading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic 
          Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[117] The sultanate was to control much
           of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although 
           at first disruptive for the <i><b><mark style="color:blueviolet">Indian elites, the sultanate largely</mark></i></b>
           left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and
            customs.[118][119] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 
            13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited
             on West and Central <b style="color:blueviolet">Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration 
             of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans
              from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic
               culture in the north.[120][121] The sultanate's raiding and weakening 
               of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous 
               Vijayanagara Empire.[122] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building
                upon the military technology of the sultanate, t</b>he empire came to control
                 much of peninsular India,[123] and <q>was to influence South Indian society for
                  long afterwards</q>.[122]
